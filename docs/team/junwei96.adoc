== PROJECT: 3VIA

---

== Overview

3VIA is a desktop application that can be used by motivated learners who wants to reinforce their knowledge. 3VIA features 3 main
components to facilitate this reinforcement of knowledge, namely learning, testing and reviewing. 3VIA was written
using Java, with the user mainly interacting with 3VIA through command line but an user interface is also provided that
was created using JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
** Set up *the foundation for the different test features in 3VIA*
*** What it does: Different generic classes that spans across the Model, UI and Storage components were written.
*** Justification: There are different test features in 3VIA. Hence, by doing so, it will allow easier future development
of the more test features.
*** Highlights: The highlights of this enhancement involves the `Model` and `Storage` feature that was written for
`TriviaTest` and `TriviaResult` respectively. It allows standardized set of data spanning across different tests to be
recorded down. This data collection would also allow for wide array of analysis allowing us to customize 3VIA for the user.

** Added *the ability to perform matching test in 3VIA* [Main Feature]
*** What it does: In this test, the user would be given a list of questions and answers. They have to match the correct
questions to their correct answer.
*** Justification: It is 1 of the 2 testing features in 3VIA. It allows users to be able to test themselves on concepts and
misconceptions that spans different questions. Allowing users to draw comparisons and similarities between different questions
and answers, coming up with insights that are not possible by just testing themselves on a per question basis.
*** Highlights: This enhancement is challenging in terms of providing the user a user friendly interface. Due to the
possibility of having a large number of questions and answers in a topic, design considerations and alternatives
are being considered.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added `CardInfoPanel`
*** Designed and implement `CardInfoPanel` to allow user to receive feedback and track their progress in each card
(which consist of a question and an answer) in 3VIA.

** Added `learn` Command
***  The `learn` Command was morphed from the `list` command in AddressBook, with the added functionality of allowing user
to type in intuitive commands such as `learn Physics` or `learn` if the user wants to see all the cards.

** Added `research` Command
***  The `research` Command allow users to browse online resources that are related to the questions in 3VIA.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=junwei96&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-12&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Functional code]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Spearheaded the morphing of the existing project from AddressBook into 3VIA, by setting up 3VIA related models and
test cases.
*** Managed releases from `v1.1` to `v1.4`.
*** In charged of scheduling, deliverables and deadline management.
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Refactored the existing `MainWindow` to allow for easier transitioning between pages.
** Documentation:
*** Drew the https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w12-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#Design-Model[UML Model Class Diagram] for 3VIA.
** Community:
*** Wrote https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W12-3/main/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3AJunWei96+[PR reviews] to improve code quality of 3VIA.
*** https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-4/main/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+junwei96+[Reported bugs and suggestions] for other teams in the class.
** Tools:
*** Added TravisCI, Coveralls and Netifly to the team repo, improving the workflow and coding standard.
