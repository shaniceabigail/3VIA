== Overview

3via is a desktop application designed for self-learners to overcome their weaknesses and enhance their knowledge
at the same time. 3via contains three vital steps in learning path: learning, testing and reviewing. Each step will direct the user into the
respective page and the user will interact with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*:

 ** Added `clear` command
 *** The `clear` command was morphed from `clear` command in AddressBook.
