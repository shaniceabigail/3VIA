== Introduction

3VIA is a great way for _learners_ to *reinforce and test out their knowledge*. Tired of using a mouse or trackpad to navigate? Don't worry, 3VIA is *optimised for a veteran Command Line Interface (CLI) user*, while still having the benefits of a beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI).

3VIA will spur and energise your desire to be that A* student, without ever leaving the keyboard. We believe that it should only take 3 steps to get that Very Important A (3VIA, get it?).

You can read the user guide from start to finish by jumping right in to <<Quick Start>> to get started or just use it as a reference. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version _9_ or later installed in your computer.
.  Download the latest `3VIA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here] and copy the file into the folder you want to use as the home folder for your 3VIA app.
.  Double-click the icon to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds and you're ready to go!

* The test aims to test the knowledge of the user with the existing questions of a specified topic that are in the trivia application.

****

The following commands can only be used during an `Open Ended Test`.

==== Answering a question:

Type your answer in the command field and press `enter` to submit your answer. If you don't have an answer in mind, you can just press `enter` with nothing in the command field. We accept your silence as an answer. +
Format: `ANSWER_FROM_USER`

==== Determining the correctness of your answer:

After answering the question, you would be given a comparison between the expected and actual answer you entered. You would be required to determine the correctness of your answer since the questions are open ended. The app will keep track of your score. +
Format: `c` (correct) OR `x` (wrong)

==== Quit the test:

Test is exited. +
Format: `exit`

=== Start a MatchTest: `testM`

Start a test of matching questions and answers for a specified topic. In a MatchTest, all the questions and answers in
that topic will be displayed. You will then have to match all the correct question to their respective answer. +
Format: `testM TOPIC`

The following commands can only be used during a `MatchTest`.

==== Enter the matching cards:

An example is given in the below screenshot, where the command of `1 2` will select the question and answer that is boxed
in green.

image::UserGuideMatchCommand.png[width="790"]

Another way to match a pair of question and answer is to solely enter the index of the answer. By doing so, we will
assume that you would be matching a question at the top to the answer that is specified. +
Format: `INDEX_OF_ANSWER`

An example of such a usage can be seen in the the below screenshot.

image::UserGuideMatchCommandWithoutQuestion.png[width="790"]

==== Quit MatchTest:

entering the `exit` command. The command will bring you to the home page. +
Format: `exit`

[NOTE]
Your attempts from an incomplete MatchTest will be discarded. Only those attempts from a completed MatchTest will
be saved into your hard disk.

=== View statistics for a certain test: `stats` `[coming in v2.0]`

Results of previous tests, questions, expected answers and the user’s answers for that particular topic will be displayed. +
Format: `stats [TOPIC]`

// tag::import[]
=== Cram More Knowledge!: `import`

****

IMPORTANT: The file path refers to the *absolute file path* of the import file.

==== Creating your import file:

Open your existing notes or create a new one. You may use any text editing programs such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.
Below are 2 rules regarding the import file type and format that must be adhered too.

. Import file type:
* The file must be in *UTF-8 format*.
* The file must be a *plain text file* (i.e. file.txt).

[start = 2]
. Import file format:

image::import_file_format.png[import file format pic]
[options = "header", cols = "1,2", caption=""]
.Formating explaination
|===
|Keys| Purpose
|kbd:[SPACE] + kbd:[t] + kbd:[/]| A space and "t/" prefix separates each topic
|kbd:[TAB]| A tab space separates a question and an answer
|kbd:[&#9166;]| A new line separates each card
|===

[WARNING]
Duplicate questions in the import text file will result in import failure.

==== Importing your file:

Now that your file is ready, head over to 3VIA and lets begin the import.

. Enter the `import` command followed by the *absolute file path* of the import file you previously created in the command
box as seen below.

image::import_step1.png[import step 1 pic, 500]

[start = 2]
. Hit enter/ return to confirm. 3VIA will now display a list of cards that has been imported.

with the cards imported.
