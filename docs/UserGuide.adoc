== Introduction

3VIA is a great way for learners to *reinforce and test out their knowledge*. Tired of using a mouse or trackpad to navigate? Don't worry, 3VIA is *optimized for a veteran Command Line Interface (CLI) user*, while still having the benefits of a beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI).

3VIA will spur and energise your desire to be that A* student, without ever leaving the keyboard. We believe that it should only take [red]#3 steps to get that Very Important A# (3VIA, get it?).

You can read the user guide from start to finish by jumping right in to <<Quick Start>> to get started or just use it as a reference. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version _9_ or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `3VIA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your 3VIA app.
.  Double-click the icon to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds and you're ready to go!
